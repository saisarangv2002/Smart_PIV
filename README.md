# Smart Particle Image Velocimetry 
Particle Image Velocimetry is a technique to determine the velocity field of domain (generally 2 Dimensional) using lasers and camera. The conventional PIV system involves expensive lasers. But this method is a simple way of determining the velocity field using a smart phone and a continuos wave laser.

The code works considering two consecutive frames of the video shot on a smart phone camera and applying cross correlation algorithm to determine the displacement of a particular window. This displacement information along with the time information taken from the camera (the interval between 2 frames of video) we obtain the veloctiy vector.
